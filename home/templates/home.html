		<p>And This is just the Start! A whole bunch of new features are being planned, and should be ready soon, including: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Slug breeding</strong> - Bored of the sound of your current slugs? cross-breed with your friends to get a whole new sound!</li>
			<li><strong>Longer songs</strong> - Imagine being able to arrange seperate loops, end to end, to make complex tracks as long as a train. WOW!</li>
			<li><strong>Accessories</strong> - Decorate your slugs with slug-cessories. From top-hats to mohawks to ball-gowns.</li>
			<li><strong>World domination</strong> - only kidding! Not all creatures from outer-space are interested in such things.</li>
