So, you're checking out the public repo for slugjam..

check out the live version at www.slugjam.net (coming very soon..)

I've been rushing to try and get slugjam up and running, and have unfortunately neglected all sorts of good practice such as documenting things as i go along, and keeping code consistant and clean. I will (hopefully) get allong to doing these things soon.

Please feel free to have a look around, and see if you can work out whats going on, and fork this if you want, but it will probably be much easier to get stuck in onvce I've had a chance to clean things up a bit.
